# Dhruv Patel's To-Do List App

This simple yet effective To-Do List App is part of my weekly project challenge as I enhance my skills in front-end development.

## Key Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface that is both inviting and easy to navigate.

## Technical Highlights

- **HTML**: Structured the app using semantic HTML5 elements.
- **CSS**: Implemented a modern, responsive design with a focus on usability and aesthetics. Employed advanced CSS properties like flexbox for layout design and box-shadow for depth.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Utilized **arrow functions** for concise syntax in event handlers.
  - Applied DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically add tasks to the list.
  - Implemented event listeners for interactive user experience.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained a deeper understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to interact with it using JavaScript.
- Enhanced my CSS skills, particularly in creating responsive designs that work on various devices.
- Practiced using JavaScript ES6 features like arrow functions for cleaner and more efficient code.

## How to Run
